    "After cycling through all 4 classes, it reports the overall accuracy using 4 classifiers on the test set. This is done by creating 4 predictions for each document in the test set, and essentially choosing the class for which the document has the highest decision value (analogous to probability). This value is either 0, 1, 2 or 3. Then, it reports the accuracy since the test set has the original values to check if it was in fact correct. This is 68% in our case.\n",

The program saves the progress of all 4 classifiers, so the user can quit at any moment and the program will pick up wherever the last accuracy was reported. These are saved in 3 files locally. The CSV file contains the labeled data already labeled, the TXT file contains information on the most recent test set predictions, and the last file contains the parameters for the Support Vector Machine for the binary model.\n",
